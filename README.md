## Notes

- The application uses Amazon Nova to optimize prompts for better video generation results
- I found sometimes that `Nova Pro` works better for image optimzation while `Nova Lite` works better for video, so you can switch the model to try. 
- Video generation may take several minutes to complete
- Generated videos are temporarily stored in the `generated_videos` directory
- Generated images are temporarily stored in the `generated_images` directory
- Both English and Chinese prompts are supported, but optimized prompts will be in English

## Example Prompts

### Text to Image example:
```

```
```

```
